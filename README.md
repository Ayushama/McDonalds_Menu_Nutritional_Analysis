# McDonald's Menu Nutritional Analysis

## Introduction  
This project dives into the nutritional makeup of McDonald‚Äôs menu items, helping us uncover which choices are healthier and which ones pack in more calories, fats, sugars, and sodium. The goal is to provide clear insights that can help anyone make smarter, more balanced decisions when ordering from the fast-food giant. Through thorough data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and insightful visualizations, this analysis shines a light on the nutritional patterns across different menu categories.

## About the Data  
The dataset used is sourced from McDonald's official menu, containing detailed nutritional information for over 260 items. Each item is broken down by key nutritional facts such as calories, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrates, dietary fiber, sugars, and protein. The menu items are organized into categories like Breakfast, Burgers, Chicken & Fish, Sides, Beverages, Desserts, and Salads, allowing for meaningful comparisons.

## Data Cleaning Process  
To ensure accuracy and consistency in the analysis, several cleaning steps were performed:  
- Removed duplicate entries to avoid skewing results.  
- Standardized category names to unify similar groups (e.g., ‚ÄúBurgers‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúBurger‚Äù).  
- Converted all serving sizes to a consistent unit, making nutritional comparisons reliable.  
- Addressed missing data by either filling gaps with category averages or removing problematic rows where necessary.  
- Verified that all numerical columns were properly formatted for analysis, ensuring smooth calculations and visualizations.

## Key Findings from Exploratory Analysis  
- **Calorie Range:** Menu items vary widely in calories, from low-calorie choices like black coffee (under 100 calories) to heavy, large meal options exceeding 1,200 calories.  
- **Macronutrient Patterns:** Burgers and chicken items are generally rich in protein, but they also tend to have higher fat and sodium content.  
- **Category Comparisons:** Salads typically have fewer calories but can contain surprisingly high sodium levels, often due to dressings and toppings.  
- **Sugar Levels:** Beverages and desserts stand out as the biggest contributors of sugar on the menu, sometimes containing more sugar than expected.

## Visualizations Included  
The project features a variety of charts and plots that help visualize these insights:  
- Bar charts that compare average calorie counts across different categories.  
- Scatter plots illustrating the balance (or trade-offs) between calories and protein in menu items.  
- Heatmaps highlighting correlations between nutritional factors like fat, sodium, and sugars.  
- Pie charts breaking down the macronutrient composition (carbs, fats, proteins) for select popular items.  
- Box plots showcasing the spread of calorie counts within each menu category, revealing variability and outliers.

## Insights & Recommendations  
- **Calorie-Heavy, Nutrient-Light Options:** Many of the large combo meals are calorie dense but don‚Äôt offer a corresponding amount of beneficial nutrients, making them less ideal for health-conscious consumers.  
- **Sodium Surprises:** Even seemingly healthy choices like salads can be loaded with sodium, mainly from dressings and toppings ‚Äî something to watch out for if you‚Äôre monitoring salt intake.  
- **Better Protein Choices:** Grilled chicken items generally provide a more favorable protein-to-calorie ratio compared to their fried counterparts, making them a smarter choice for protein seekers.  
- **Sugar Alert:** Specialty beverages can contain more sugar than desserts, so it‚Äôs worth checking nutritional info before indulging.  
- **Practical Tips:** To make healthier choices at McDonald's, opt for grilled proteins, avoid upsizing meals, and be cautious about sauces, dressings, and sugary drinks.
